### shards and replicas

### Running a cluster without replicas

### segment

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15426441/understanding-segments-in-elasticsearch
> OSs heavily cache data you write to a file. If the OS enforced every write to hit the drive, things would be very slow. fsync (among other things) allows you to control when the data should hit the drive.

### flush and fsync

### refresh and flush
https://qbox.io/blog/refresh-flush-operations-elasticsearch-guide

### segment merge
 every search request has to check every segment in turn; the more segments there are, the slower the search will be.

Elasticsearch solves this problem by merging segments in the background. Small segments are merged into bigger segments

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/merge-process.html

### when new documents are searchable
While indexing, the refresh process creates new segments and opens them for search.

The merge process selects a few segments of similar size and merges them into a new bigger segment in the background. This does not interrupt indexing and searching.

### check status of the cluster
```
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty'
{
  "cluster_name" : "es_cluster",
  "status" : "green",
  "timed_out" : false,
  "number_of_nodes" : 3,
  "number_of_data_nodes" : 3,
  "active_primary_shards" : 89,
  "active_shards" : 193,
  "relocating_shards" : 0,
  "initializing_shards" : 0,
  "unassigned_shards" : 0,
  "delayed_unassigned_shards" : 0,
  "number_of_pending_tasks" : 0,
  "number_of_in_flight_fetch" : 0,
  "task_max_waiting_in_queue_millis" : 0,
  "active_shards_percent_as_number" : 100.0
}

```

### list all indices

```
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v' 

```

### list which node contains which shards

 below will tell the detailed view of what nodes contain which shards, and it will tell if it’s a primary or replica

```
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_cat/shards?v"
...
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/shards/index-name'
